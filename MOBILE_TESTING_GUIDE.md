# ðŸ“± COMPLETE MOBILE APP TESTING GUIDE

## ðŸŽ¯ **STEP-BY-STEP MOBILE TESTING PROCESS**

### **STEP 1: SETUP WORKING FLUTTER APP**

I've created a clean, working version of your Flutter app. Here's how to use it:

```bash
# Navigate to Flutter project
cd hostelconnect/mobile

# Backup current pubspec.yaml
cp pubspec.yaml pubspec_backup.yaml

# Use the working version
cp pubspec_working.yaml pubspec.yaml

# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### **STEP 2: TEST ON ANDROID EMULATOR**

**2.1 Start Android Emulator:**
```bash
# List available emulators
flutter emulators

# Start an emulator (replace with your emulator name)
flutter emulators --launch Pixel_7_API_34
```

**2.2 Run the App:**
```bash
# Run on emulator
flutter run lib/main_working.dart

# Or run in debug mode
flutter run --debug lib/main_working.dart
```

**2.3 Test Features:**
- âœ… Login with demo credentials
- âœ… Navigate between different user roles
- âœ… Test all 6 quick action buttons
- âœ… Verify responsive design
- âœ… Test logout functionality

### **STEP 3: TEST ON REAL ANDROID DEVICE**

**3.1 Enable Developer Options:**
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **About Phone**
2. Tap **Build Number** 7 times
3. Go back to **Settings** â†’ **Developer Options**
4. Enable **USB Debugging**

**3.2 Connect Device:**
```bash
# Connect your Android device via USB
# Check if device is detected
flutter devices

# Run on connected device
flutter run lib/main_working.dart -d <device_id>
```

**3.3 Test on Real Device:**
- âœ… Touch interactions
- âœ… Performance on real hardware
- âœ… Different screen sizes
- âœ… Camera functionality (if needed)
- âœ… Network connectivity

### **STEP 4: BUILD RELEASE VERSION**

**4.1 Build APK for Testing:**
```bash
# Build debug APK
flutter build apk --debug

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# APK location: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

**4.2 Install APK on Device:**
```bash
# Install debug APK
flutter install

# Or manually install
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### **STEP 5: PREPARE FOR PLAY STORE**

**5.1 Build App Bundle (AAB):**
```bash
# Build release AAB
flutter build appbundle --release

# AAB location: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

**5.2 Test AAB File:**
```bash
# Install AAB for testing
bundletool build-apks --bundle=build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --output=app.apks
bundletool install-apks --apks=app.apks
