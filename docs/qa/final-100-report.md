## 🎮 Demo Accounts

All accounts use password: `password123`

- **Student:** `student@demo.com` → Student Dashboard
- **Warden:** `warden@demo.com` → Warden Dashboard  
- **Warden Head:** `head@demo.com` → Admin Dashboard
- **Super Admin:** `admin@demo.com` → Admin Dashboard
- **Chef:** `chef@demo.com` → Chef Dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Network Issues
- **Emulator:** Use `http://10.0.2.2:3000` (Android emulator localhost)
- **Alternative:** Use `adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000` for port forwarding
- **CORS:** Enabled for development (`origin: true`)
- **Cleartext:** HTTP allowed for dev (`android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`)

### Common Issues
1. **"Unable to connect to server"** → Check API server is running on port 3000
2. **"Null is not a subtype of String"** → Fixed with null-safe parsing
3. **Build errors** → Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
4. **Emulator not found** → Use `flutter emulators --launch Pixel_7_API_34`
